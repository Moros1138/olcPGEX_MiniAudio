# Examples

To see the demo running, [visit here](https://www.moros1138.com/demos/olcPGEX_MiniAudio/).


I'm going to assume you're here because you already build with PGE, so I don't have to walk you through setting up your environments. HOWEVER, if my assumption proves incorrect, I suggest you spend some time reading the PGE header file, it's loaded with instructions and helpful advice!


To build the demo for linux:
```
make linux
```

To build the demo for emscripten:

```
make emscripten
```

If you want to build both, and have both environments active, run:

```
make
```
